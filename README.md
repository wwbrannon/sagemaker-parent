# sagemaker-parent

This repo defines a parent container for Amazon SageMaker custom algorithms (which are implemented as Docker containers). Adapted and lightly modified from [Amazon's example](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/advanced_functionality/scikit_bring_your_own/scikit_bring_your_own.ipynb).
